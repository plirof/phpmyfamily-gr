Preamble
========

Please read the LICENSE file included with this distribution.

phpmyfamily is intended to allow geographically dispersed family members
to maintain a central database of research which is readily accessable and editable.
It allows family members to contribute as and when information becomes available
without requiring them to send it to a central 'custodian.'  At the same time,
it allows the general public to view your tree (subject to the restrictions below)
to see if they match.

Infomation regarding the identities of people born after 01/01/1910 are hidden from
general browsing but are freely available to 'registered' users.

As well as maintaining links for parents, siblings, spouses and children, there are
free text capabilities for the recording of anecdotes, information etc, recording of
census details, capability to upload images and document transcripts.  Please note that
html tags in the notes field WILL be rendered.

phpmyfamily is NOT intended to provide a 'all the worlds related' database with
many users working on separate trees aka familyreunited.com.  While there is no
requirement for individuals in the database to be linked into a central structure,
all users can see all records etc.


Installation
============

The pre-requisites for installation are
0. PHP >= 4.2.0
1. mySQL

0. Uncompress the archive to the directory of your choice.
1. Move inc/database.inc to inc/database.inc.php and edit it to include your database connection details
2. Point your browser at admin/install.php.  
	This will populate your database with the needed tables and install the default user name and password combination (admin/admin).  
	It is recommended that you change these values as soon as possible.  
	Additionally, a blank record is created for the first male in your tree.  
	This will be your starting point and should be edited as soon as possible.  
	Remember to delete the admin directory after completion of the installation.
3. Login as admin and go to the preferences page and thence to the admin page where you can enter your site specific configuration details.

Optional Configuration
======================

The program will work without these configuration steps but with some limitations.
These options can be controlled via the preferences page.

Apache Configuration
--------------------
In order to use the dojo widgets backed with REST web services it is necessary to enable the use of the .htaccess file in the services directory.
This is down via use of the AllowOverride directive in the Apache configuration
<Directory /var/www/pmf2>
                Options FollowSymLinks
                AllowOverride FileInfo
        </Directory>

GraphViz Configuration
----------------------
GraphViz can be used to render the complete family tree.

To enable the use of graphviz it is necessary to configure php to be allowed to call the external graphviz commands and to install the pear Image_GraphViz package

e.g. on Ubuntu
pear install Image_GraphViz
apt-get install graphviz


Upgrading
=========

From v2.0 to v2.1
-----------------


From v1 to v2
--------------
Take a database backup - there are significant changes done by these scripts
Run the admin/upgrade-1.4.2-2.0.0.php script (You can now remove inc/config.inc.php)
Run the admin/upgrade-2.0.0-beta.php script
Optionally install dojo version 1.3.0 from dojotoolkit.org - path can be changed in inc/header.inc.php
	This allows the dojo based tabs and panes layout options to work
Optionally run the admin/mysql5.php script - this creates a view called person_detail which provides a similiar way of
looking at the data to the old people table when using SQL directly.
Optionally run the admin/upgrade-1.4.2-2.0.0-drop.php this removes columns which are no longer used

From v1.2.5 to 1.3.0
--------------------
If upgrading to, run the admin/upgrade-1.2.5-1.3.0.php script.  
This will make the necessary database changes.  

Remember to delete the admin directory after completion of the upgrade.
